# MusCAT: A multi-scale, hybrid federated system for privacy-preserving epidemic surveillance and risk prediction

**Primary Focus Area (select one):** De-identification

**De-identification Keywords (select any relevant):** Differential Privacy, Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption, Machine Learning, Federated Learning 

**Brief Description:**
Our tool, MusCAT, is a multi-scale, hybrid federated system for privacy-preserving epidemic surveillance and risk prediction. 
It combines differential privacy, multiparty homomorphic encryption, and federated learning to jointly analyze private data held by multiple federation units with formal privacy guarantees.
MusCAT came in second place as a solution in the [U.S. PETs Prize Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/group/nist-federated-learning/).

**Additional Notes:** Paper describing our solution: TODO
